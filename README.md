# Welcome to SET Revision!

SET Revision is a website to help you identify "sets" in the card game SET.

The code in this repository is aimed for learners of React and TypeScript, hence the usage of `// TUTORIAL` comments.

## About SET

The aim of SET is to identify "sets".

Each card is unique, and has four features. These features are the colour (red, green, or purple), count (one, two, or three), shading (solid, striped, or outline), and shape (diamond, pill, or squiggle).

A "set" is three cards where each feature is either the same on all the cards or different on all the cards.

Find the game [here](https://www.playmonster.com/product/set/).

1. Clone this repo, and `cd` into it
